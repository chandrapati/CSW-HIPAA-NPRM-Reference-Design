# Cisco Secure Workload — HIPAA Security Rule (**2025 NPRM**) Alignment
## Reference Design | Proposed Rule — **Not Final Law**

**Version:** 1.0  
**Basis of mapping:** HHS **Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)** updates to the HIPAA Security Rule (published **January 2025** — confirm effective/final rule in **Federal Register** before relying on this document for legal compliance).  
**Use Case:** Fresh install, hybrid environment (on-prem + cloud)  
**Critical caveat:** This reference design interprets a **proposed** regulation. The **final rule may differ**. Maintain parallel compliance with the **current** Security Rule until amendments are effective.

---

> **Coverage legend** — this reference design and its compliance report use three words:
> - 🟢 **Direct** — CSW produces the primary evidence artifact.
> - 🟠 **Supporting** — CSW produces an input that feeds or complements another control.
> - ⚪ **Evidence Required** *(supplied outside CSW)* — CSW produces nothing here; the item is in scope for compliance but out of scope for CSW, so the customer evidences it via another control, tool, or process. A scope boundary, not a gap or "unsupported."

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Covered entities and business associates planning for **proposed** HIPAA Security Rule modernisation, security architects who must **pre-position** technical controls (especially **mandatory network segmentation**), and compliance officers who need a **crosswalk** from **today’s rule** to the **NPRM**.

**Questions this reference design helps you answer:**

- *If **network segmentation** becomes **required** (no longer merely addressable), what **technical proof** can I operate **continuously**?* (**§164.312(a)(2)(vi)** — **headline CSW mapping**)
- *How do strengthened **access controls** and **technology asset inventory** change what I must **instrument**?* (**§164.312(a)(1)**, **§164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)**)
- *How does the NPRM’s emphasis on **inventory + network map** for **risk analysis** translate into **CSW ADM** and exports?* (**§164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B)**)
- *What **vulnerability management** evidence does CSW produce for the **new** NPRM expectation?* (**§164.308(a)(2)**)
- *If **audit log retention** extends to **24 months**, how do I **export** CSW telemetry to **durable storage / SIEM**?* (**§164.312(b)**)
- *If **encryption** for ePHI **at rest and in transit** moves to **required**, how does CSW support **plaintext detection and blocking** while I remediate apps?* (Map to **final NPRM** section numbers — today’s rule places **encryption in transit** primarily under **§164.312(e)** and related provisions; NPRM may **renumber**.)
- *For **72-hour HHS notification**, what **forensic timelines** can CSW contribute?* (**§164.308(a)(6)**)
- *For **annual compliance assessment**, what **continuous** artefacts supplement point-in-time audits?* (**§164.306(e)**)

**What you'll need.** Your organisation’s **current HIPAA** compliance baseline (see the **existing CSW HIPAA runbook** below), ePHI data-flow documentation, SIEM / log retention architecture, and legal review of the **final** rule when published.

**Where to start.** Section 1 (**NPRM vs current rule** quick reference); sections 2–4 for deployment; sections 5–7 for policy; section 8 for **control mapping**; section 9 **boundaries**; section 10 **evidence** aligned to **24-month** thinking.

## CSW primer — if you are new to Cisco Secure Workload

Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) is a **workload protection platform**. A lightweight **agent** on each server/VM/container observes processes and network flows; **cloud connectors** add AWS/Azure/GCP inventory where agents are not deployed.

| CSW term | Meaning | Why compliance teams care |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|
| **Scope** | Logical boundary (CDE, PHI zone, CUI enclave) | Defines the systems you must prove are isolated |
| **Label / filter** | Tag or query assigning workloads to scopes | Automates scope membership — reduces drift |
| **ADM** | Application Dependency Mapping from observed traffic | **Live** network/data-flow diagram for assessors |
| **Workspace** | Policy container for one scope or application | Where allow/deny rules are authored |
| **Monitor → Simulation → Enforce** | Safe rollout sequence | Simulation = change-board evidence before blocking traffic |
| **Denied Connections** | Log of flows blocked by policy | Primary proof that enforcement **operates** |

**Console areas:** Investigate (inventory, flows, vulns) · Defend/Segmentation (policy) · Manage (agents) · Platform (connectors) · Administration (audit log)

**Read next:** [Compliance evidence playbook](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/docs/compliance-evidence-playbook.md) (full step-by-step) · [About CSW](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/docs/about-csw.md) (platform intro)

## Universal evidence workflow

Execute these phases for **this framework's** compliance boundary. Map exports to control IDs in the **Reporting & Evidence** section below.

| Phase | Goal | Key CSW actions | Typical duration |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **1 — Coverage** | Every in-scope workload in CSW | Install agents/connectors; apply compliance labels; create scope | Days 1–10 |
| **2 — Baseline** | Machine-generated flow map | Run ADM ≥2 weeks; export clusters; app-owner signoff | Days 11–28 |
| **3 — Policy** | Designed isolation before enforce | Build workspace; Simulation mode; fix false positives | Days 29–45 |
| **4 — Operate** | Continuous proof between audits | Enforce; quarterly export pack; ADM refresh every 90 days | Ongoing |

### Phase 1 checklist (coverage)

- [ ] In-scope host list reconciled to CSW Inventory (100% or documented exceptions)
- [ ] Labels applied: `compliance:<framework>`, `data:<classification>`, `env:<tier>`
- [ ] CSW scope created matching compliance boundary
- [ ] **Export:** inventory CSV + agent status screenshot

### Phase 2 checklist (baseline)

- [ ] ADM running on compliance scope for full business cycle (≥2 weeks)
- [ ] Unexpected flows documented (shadow IT, vendor egress, scope creep)
- [ ] App owners signed cluster-to-application mapping
- [ ] **Export:** ADM diagram + flow samples with process context

### Phase 3 checklist (policy)

- [ ] Default-deny posture defined for sensitive scope
- [ ] ADM-imported rules refined; Simulation run ≥1 week
- [ ] Change tickets for false-positive fixes; exception register updated
- [ ] **Export:** policy export + simulation report

### Phase 4 checklist (operate)

- [ ] Enforcement enabled on pilot scope; negative test recorded in Denied Connections
- [ ] Quarterly pack: inventory, policy, denies, vulns, audit log (see playbook)
- [ ] SIEM integration verified (sample events)
- [ ] **Export:** enforcement screenshot + quarterly binder

### What CSW evidence does not replace

Physical access, HR/training records, encryption key management, signed BAAs/vendor contracts, formal pen tests, and assessor attestation still require separate programmes. CSW addresses the **workload-resident** slice: segmentation, flows, process context, vuln reachability, and change drift.

---

## CSW effectiveness for this framework

- Supports proposed mandatory segmentation evidence (§164.312(a)(2)(vi))
- Asset inventory + 72-hour breach timeline inputs from flow/process search
- Continuous logging architecture vs. point-in-time log samples

**Compared to manual programmes:** static diagrams and annual firewall samples age immediately; CSW ties evidence to **live workload behaviour** and produces queryable exports on demand — supporting "operating effectively" language in PCI v4.0, SOC 2 CC7, and HIPAA risk analysis.

---

## 1. Overview

The **2025 NPRM** proposes substantial updates to the HIPAA Security Rule to reflect modern threats, cloud adoption, and accountability expectations. **Cisco Secure Workload (CSW)** remains a **technical control and evidence system** for workload visibility, **microsegmentation**, vulnerability context with **EPSS**, and forensic telemetry. It does **not** satisfy administrative, physical, or legal obligations by itself.

### 1.1 “Current rule” vs. NPRM (operational implications)

Use this table with your compliance and privacy counsel; citations follow **proposed** structure as commonly discussed in the NPRM — **verify against the official FR text**.

| Theme | Current Security Rule posture (typical) | NPRM direction (why it matters for CSW) |
|---|---|---|
| **Network segmentation** | Often treated as **addressable**; organisations document compensating controls | **Mandatory** network segmentation between ePHI and non-ePHI — **microsegmentation becomes a primary technical anchor** |
| **Technology asset inventory** | Implicit in risk analysis; variable formality | **Explicit** inventory requirement — **CSW discovery + software inventory** maps cleanly |
| **Risk analysis** | Required; depth varies | **Enhanced** — expects **inventory + network map** — **ADM + flow topology** |
| **Vulnerability management** | Addressed under risk management / §164.308(a)(8) in practice | **Proposed explicit vulnerability management** — **CVE + EPSS + reachability** |
| **Audit controls / retention** | Retention not specified in HIPAA to match **24 months** uniformly | **Proposed 24-month** log retention — **export architecture to SIEM/object store** |
| **Encryption** | Some encryption elements **addressable** in current rule | **Proposed required** ePHI encryption **at rest and in transit** — CSW assists with **plaintext detection/blocking**; **encryption implementation** remains with apps/storage |
| **Incident notification** | Breach notification rules under separate provisions | NPRM discourse on **timely HHS notification** (e.g. **72-hour** themes in proposals) — **forensic evidence speed** |
| **Annual compliance assessment** | Evaluation under §164.308(a)(8) | **Proposed annual compliance assessment** — **continuous monitoring evidence** from CSW |

### 1.2 Relationship to the existing HIPAA technical runbook

For controls that **do not change** materially in the NPRM, the detailed phased guidance in the **current-rule runbook** remains authoritative for CSW deployment patterns:

**Primary cross-reference:** [`../HIPAA/CSW-HIPAA-Technical-Runbook.md`](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/HIPAA/CSW-HIPAA-Technical-Runbook.md)

| NPRM topic | CSW focus **this** document | Deeper procedural detail |
|---|---|---|
| ePHI zone architecture, PHI labelling, ADM for clinical apps | §1–§5 overview + **segmentation headline** | [HIPAA runbook §4–§5](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/HIPAA/CSW-HIPAA-Technical-Runbook.md) |
| Policy workspace patterns (simulation → enforcement) | §6–§7 | [HIPAA runbook §6](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/HIPAA/CSW-HIPAA-Technical-Runbook.md) |
| Vulnerability management | §5–§6, §8 | [HIPAA runbook §8](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/HIPAA/CSW-HIPAA-Technical-Runbook.md) |
| Monitoring & forensic exports | §7–§10 | [HIPAA runbook §9–§10](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/HIPAA/CSW-HIPAA-Technical-Runbook.md) |

**Practice:** Treat the **HIPAA runbook** as the **implementation backbone**; treat **this NPRM runbook** as the **delta tracker + evidence adjustments** (especially **segmentation**, **24-month logs**, **inventory**, **vuln programme**).

---

## 2. Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before expanding CSW for **NPRM readiness**:

- [ ] **Legal / compliance** confirms which **proposed** provisions your roadmap assumes (prioritise **segmentation** and **logging retention** architecture early)
- [ ] CSW cluster reachable; sensors planned for **all** ePHI-adjacent tiers (not only “Crown Jewel” servers)
- [ ] **SIEM / log lake** capacity scoping for **≥24-month** CSW-derived audit metadata (see §10)
- [ ] Identity integration path chosen for **identity-aware enforcement** (**§164.312(a)(1)** alignment)
- [ ] **Plaintext protocol inventory** workshop scheduled (TLS migration backlog)
- [ ] Stakeholders: CISO, HIPAA Security Officer, Infrastructure, **Privacy Officer** (if data-use discussions arise)

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Sensor deployment (Days 1–5)

Follow the **HIPAA runbook** steps verbatim for install patterns; repeat here for continuity.

### 3.1 On-premises

```bash
# Linux (RHEL/CentOS/Ubuntu family)
rpm -ivh tet-sensor-<version>.rpm    # RHEL/CentOS
dpkg -i tet-sensor-<version>.deb     # Ubuntu/Debian

systemctl status csw-agent || systemctl status tet-sensor
```

### 3.2 Cloud connectors

```
CSW UI → Platform → External Orchestrators
  → AWS / Azure / GCP
  → Enable inventory + flow ingestion appropriate to your license
```

### 3.3 NPRM-oriented sensor settings

- **Monitoring-only** initially on newly onboarded ePHI-adjacent tiers (**avoid disruption** during risk analysis refresh)
- Enable artefacts needed for **technology asset inventory**: instance IDs, agent IDs, **software packages**
- Tags: `compliance:hipaa`, `data:ephi`, `nprm-scope:2025-planning` (or your internal programme name)

---

## 4. Phase 2 — Scope & technology asset inventory (Days 6–12)

### 4.1 Inventory as a **first-class** NPRM deliverable (**§164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)**)

The NPRM elevates **technology asset inventory** from implied to **explicit**. CSW contributions:

| Inventory element | CSW source | Evidence tip |
|---|---|---|
| Workload identity | Agent inventory / cloud connector | Export **weekly** during remediation projects |
| Software packages & versions | Software inventory module | Join to CMDB via `external_id` / hostname |
| Network exposure | Listen sockets + ADM edges | Attach to **risk register** entries |

### 4.2 Segmentation-oriented scope design (**§164.312(a)(2)(vi)**)

Rebuild (or validate) scopes assuming **ePHI vs non-ePHI** is **mandatory** in enforcement, not “best effort”:

```
PHI-Zone (enforce deny-by-default)
Non-PHI-Enterprise
DMZ / Internet Edge
BA-Partner-Connectivity
Admin-Jump-Path
```

**Delta from current HIPAA runbook:** same **zone** labels — **stronger expectation** that **deny-by-default between PHI and non-PHI** is **documented, enforced, and drift-monitored**, not optional.

---

## 5. Phase 3 — Visibility, network map & risk analysis refresh (Days 13–30)

### 5.1 Risk analysis support (**§164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B)**)

Proposed rule direction: risk analysis should **incorporate** a **technology asset inventory** and **network map**. CSW **ADM** supplies an **observed** map:

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Application Dependency Mapping
  → Workspace: "HIPAA-NPRM-RiskAnalysis-2025"
  → Scope: organisation root or PHI-Zone + dependencies
  → Window: minimum 2–4 weeks
  → Process + user context enabled
```

**Deliverable:** ADM export + narrative tying each **ePHI system class** to observed **ingress/egress** partners (including **BAs** by FQDN/IP).

### 5.2 Vulnerability management programme (**§164.308(a)(2)** — *proposed*)

Operationalise **continuous** assessment:

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Vulnerability Report
  → Scope: PHI-Zone + admins paths
  → Prioritise: CVSS + EPSS + internet/exposed reachability
```

Map outputs into your **enterprise vuln SLAs**; CSW answers: **which ePHI-adjacent workloads are both vulnerable and reachable**.

---

## 6. Phase 4 — Policy design (microsegmentation — **headline**)

### 6.1 **§164.312(a)(2)(vi) Network segmentation** — deny-by-default between ePHI and non-ePHI

**CSW mapping (headline):** Host-based **microsegmentation** provides **default-deny** workload enforcement between **ePHI** and **non-ePHI** segments, **independent of** coarse subnet ACLs—closing gaps when **VPC/VNet** posture drifts or **east-west** paths bypass perimeter controls.

**Example policy themes (conceptual):**

```
DENY: Non-PHI-Enterprise → PHI-Zone (default deny; allowlist jump + monitored admin only)
DENY: PHI-Zone → Internet (except approved egress via secured proxy / known APIs)
ALLOW: Clinical-Workstations → EHR-Frontends (tcp/443)
ALLOW: EHR-App → EHR-DB (application-appropriate ports — prefer encrypted protocols)
```

### 6.2 **§164.312(a)(1) Access control** — identity-aware enforcement

Where CSW integrates directory / workload identity:

- Restrict **which identities / device classes** may initiate flows **into** PHI-Zone
- Tie **break-glass** and **emergency access** subnets to **time-bound** allow rules with **alerting**

*(See [HIPAA runbook §6](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/HIPAA/CSW-HIPAA-Technical-Runbook.md) for concrete allowlist templates.)*

### 6.3 Encryption (at rest & in transit) — plaintext visibility & blocking

> **Citation note:** Under the **current** Security Rule, **§164.312(d)** is *Person or entity authentication*; **encryption in transit** is addressed under **§164.312(e)**, and cryptographic controls also appear elsewhere (e.g. **§164.312(a)(2)(iv)**). The **NPRM** may consolidate or renumber — **replace headings below with final regulatory text** when published.

CSW **does not encrypt data at rest**; it **detects and can block** risky **cleartext transit** paths to drive remediation:

```
ALERT → DENY (after app owner sign-off):
  PHI-Zone → Any on tcp/80, tcp/389, legacy unencrypted database ports where TLS is mandated
```

Coordinate with **database TLS**, **storage encryption (CMK/TDE)**, and **application crypto** for full **at rest + in transit** compliance.

---

## 7. Phase 5 — Enforcement, incidents & continuous assurance

### 7.1 Enforcement stages

| Stage | Objective |
|---|---|
| Simulation | Prove **no clinical breakage** before mandatory segmentation stance hardens |
| Phased enforce | **Default deny** between PHI/non-PHI first; refine intra-PHI least privilege second |
| Steady state | **Continuous** policy review aligned to **annual assessment** cadence |

### 7.2 **§164.308(a)(6) Security incident** — **72-hour** notification narrative

For **rapid timelines** (per **proposed** emphasis):

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Flow Search
  → Narrow to compromise window + affected workload

CSW UI → Investigate → Process Search
  → Parent/child chain + hash novelty
```

Export **immutable** bundles (hash the export file in your IR ticket).

### 7.3 **§164.306(e) Annual compliance assessment** (*proposed*)

Maintain **continuous** artefacts:

- Monthly: inventory delta report  
- Quarterly: policy workspace review + ADM refresh  
- Annual: formal assessment package assembling the above + **management attestation**

---

## 8. Control-by-control mapping (NPRM / Security Rule — proposed)

**Legend:** Items marked **NPRM Δ** indicate a **material change from typical current-rule implementation** per proposal. **Final text may differ.**

|Provision (proposed / discussed)|Requirement intent (summary)|CSW capability|Evidence produced|
|---|---|---|---|
|**§164.312(a)(2)(vi)** Network segmentation — **NPRM Δ** **mandatory**|Segment ePHI from non-ePHI; limit lateral movement|**Deny-by-default microsegmentation** between PHI-Zone and others; ADM-backed rules|Policy export; enforcement hit logs; ADM diagram; change history|
|**§164.312(a)(1)** Access control — **strengthened**|Ensure only authorised users/processes access|**Identity-aware** segmentation; process-level visibility; scoped allowlists|Identity-scoped policy; flow logs with process/user context|
|**§164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)** Technology asset inventory — **NPRM emphasis**|Maintain accurate tech asset inventory|**Automatic workload discovery**; **software inventory**|Scheduled CSV/JSON exports; CMDB reconciliation|
|**§164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B)** Risk analysis — **network map / inventory**|Risk analysis uses inventory & **network map**|**ADM** + flow topology exports|ADM workspace + methodology memo|
|**§164.308(a)(2)** Vulnerability management — **new (proposed)**|Active vuln identification & mitigation tracking|**CVE awareness**, **EPSS**, exposure/**reachability**|Trended vuln backlog; “critical exposed” views|
|**§164.312(b)** Audit controls — **24-month retention (proposed)**|Record & examine ePHI access; **retain logs**|**Flow + process telemetry** exported to SIEM/storage meeting retention|SIEM retention proofs; sample queries; export manifests|
|Encryption / authentication (**verify final NPRM §**) — *today:* **§164.312(e)** transit; **§164.312(d)** authentication; NPRM may change|**Encryption** of ePHI **at rest & in transit** — **required (proposed)**|**Plaintext detection/blocking**; path hardening telemetry|Protocol reports; pre/post remediation flows|
|**§164.308(a)(6)** Security incident procedures|**Timely** response & notification (e.g. **72-hour HHS** themes in proposal)|**Forensic** flow/process recon|IR export bundles; timeline|
|**§164.306(e)** Annual compliance assessment (**proposed**)|Periodic effectiveness review|Continuous monitoring dashboards + quarterly exports|Assessment workbook appendices|

---

## 9. Boundaries — what CSW does **not** cover

- **Legal interpretation** of the NPRM or **final rule** — requires **counsel**.
- **Encryption key management & crypto implementation** — CSW flags **plaintext** and **enforces paths**; **HSM/KMS/TDE** are separate.
- **HIPAA Privacy Rule** operational workflows (e.g. patient rights) — not CSW scope.
- **BAA negotiation & vendor risk scoring** — contractual; CSW shows **technical egress/ingress facts**.
- **Complete audit log retention in CSW alone** — for **24-month** programmes, plan **SIEM/archive**; verify **integrity** and **access controls** on archives.
- **Malware prevention as a sole control** — pair with **EDR**; CSW adds **segmentation** and **process intelligence**.

---

## 10. Audit preparation & **24-month** evidence export architecture

### 10.1 Why architecture matters for **§164.312(b)**

If **24-month retention** becomes required, **interactive UI lookups** alone are insufficient. Design **forward** to **centralised storage**:

| Layer | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Real-time | Stream **alerts / enforcement / metadata-rich flows** to SIEM |
| Batch | Nightly **exports** to object storage (versioned bucket) |
| Integrity | Object **versioning / legal hold**; hash manifests in GRC tool |

### 10.2 Bash automation sketch (customer-specific endpoints)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
TS="$(date +%Y%m%d)"
EVIDENCE_ROOT="/secure/hipaa-nprm-evidence/${TS}"
mkdir -p "${EVIDENCE_ROOT}"

# Pseudocode — replace with CSW-supported API/CLI for your release:
# python3 scripts/csw_export_flows.py --scope PHI-Zone --start -P30D --out "${EVIDENCE_ROOT}/flows.jsonl"
# python3 scripts/csw_export_inventory.py --scope PHI-Zone --out "${EVIDENCE_ROOT}/inventory.json"
# sha256sum "${EVIDENCE_ROOT}/"* > "${EVIDENCE_ROOT}/MANIFEST.sha256"
```

### 10.3 Quarterly evidence pack (suggested)

| Item | Source | NPRM relevance |
|---|---|---|
| Segmentation policy PDF/JSON | CSW Defend | §164.312(a)(2)(vi) |
| ADM export | CSW Investigate | §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B) |
| Inventory | CSW Inventory | §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) |
| Critical CVE + EPSS list | CSW Vulnerabilities | §164.308(a)(2) |
| Plaintext flow exceptions | Flow search | §164.312(e) *today* / NPRM encryption — verify final |
| SIEM retention attestation | GRC | §164.312(b) |

### 10.4 **Current rule** evidence cadence

Continue **existing** quarterly practices from [`../HIPAA/CSW-HIPAA-Technical-Runbook.md` §10](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/HIPAA/CSW-HIPAA-Technical-Runbook.md) until the NPRM is **final** and **effective**; **add** the artefacts above where the **proposed** rule creates **new auditable expectations**.

---

## 11. Common pitfalls (NPRM-oriented)

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Treating NPRM citations as **final law** | Track **Federal Register**; update mappings after **final rule** |
| **Segmentation on paper only** | Move from **simulation to enforce** with documented CAB approvals |
| **SIEM costs** surprise at **24 months** | Model **data volume** early; filter **high-value** events |
| Assuming **TLS by port** | Inspect **actual protocol** & termination; **east-west** matters |
| **Cloud blind spots** | Fix connector IAM; include **ephemeral** workloads |
